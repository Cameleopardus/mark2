# 
# As you might have expected, the scripts plugin is ridiculously overcomplicated and stupid.
# It uses a cron-like syntax:
#  m h dom mon dow command...
# 
# where everything except command is a range specifier.
# Valid range specifiers consist of a number in a reasonable range for that thing.
# (consult the cron docs if you must, though we use exclusively 1 for Monday in the 'dow' field)
# 
# 'command' is executed in a subshell as configured by mark2.properties, unless it starts with '~'
# or '/' in which case it is run as a plugin command or server command, respectively. Since there
# are obvious cases where you would want a shell command starting in both of these, you can prefix
# with '~~' to force the command to be executed by the shell.
# 
# A handy example: save everything on the hour, and delete the filesystem 10 minutes later:
#0   * * * * ~save
#10  * * * * rm -rf /*
# 
# You can also specify events using '@eventname' to replace everything except the command itself.
# As of this writing, available events are 'startup', 'shutdown', and 'post-save'.
# **Note that since Minecraft helpfully tells you it's finished saving before it actually saves, you
# may want to use timings instead of this event.**
# 

# m h dom mon dow
 0  * * * *  ~save
 10 * * * *  ~~/path/to/my/save/script.sh
 @shutdown   echo THE END IS NIGH | wall
